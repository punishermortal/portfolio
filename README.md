I created a portfolio website using JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, and HTML to showcase my skills and projects. The site features a modern, responsive design with dynamic elements and smooth transitions, highlighting my expertise in full stack development and RESTful APIs. It offers clear navigation and detailed project descriptions.
